Themed hand-held calculator with clickable buttons and keyboard support.

Written with Vanilla CSS and Typescript.

To modify the logic, edit the TS file (compiles to JS)

Use tsc -p ./build/tsconfig.json when compiling from TS to js

Notes:

For Chrome and Firefox, do not hover over the AC button after switching from keyboard to clicking button.
This is easily visible in Google Chrome (but not in Firefox).
This is not an issue in Safari (Webkit).

Also, / in Firefox is quick find.
